                    We both had demanding full-time jobs, with little time left to cook in the evenings. 
                    On weekends, though, we'd sleep in and take our time to craft delicious breakfasts.
                    Our favourite was the breakfast wrap, because it is so versatile and delicious.
                    We noticed that it wasn't a common menu option at breakfast and brunch restaurants in our city.
                    So we decided to quit our jobs and start a restaurent to bring breakfast wraps to everyone!

                        We serve breakfast wraps of all varieties - a wrap for each purse! 
                        All wraps come with eggs and cheese, and can be ordered in a small or large size.
                        You can go with The Mexican, which has mince and fresh coriander.
                        Then there's The Spaniard, with baked beans and chorizo. 
                        The Old Brit has bacon or sausage, and The Frenchman gets you blue cheese.
                        The Norseman rolls in some salmon, and Veggie Nation prefers in with baby spinach.
                        Take your pick of these, and many more.

                        We work with a wonderful team. Sally makes the magic happen in the kitchen. 
                        Anisha oversees logistics, finances and deliveries. Tammy delights customers in the front of house, 
                        and Chris tag-teams with Sally in the kitchen.
