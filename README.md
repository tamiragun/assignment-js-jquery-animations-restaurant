# Fictitious animated restaurant

This was an assignment for the JavaScript portion of my coding bootcamp. It is the website of a fictitious restaurant and allows the user to experiment with different animations by clicking on the different buttons or elements on the page.

**Stack used**: HTML - SCSS - Sass - JavaScript - jQuery

## The brief

These were the detailed instructions for the assignment:

- Create a basic HTML file called restaurant.html with the following basic elements:
    - The main heading being the name of your restaurant.
    - 3 subheadings: “Our Story”, “Our Food” and “Our People”
    - Each subheading needs a brief description in paragraph form to elaborate on these subheadings (the paragraphs can be short)
    - Each paragraph should be accompanied by a picture.
- Import the jQuery library into your HTML document.
- Create a jQuery command that will create an alert once the page has loaded.
- Create a jQuery command that will change the background once the page has loaded.
- Create a jQuery function which changes only a single paragraph’s styling
- Create a jQuery function which fades out any object that is clicked on. 
- Create a jQuery function which creates a drop-down menu with the use of an accordion animation style when each section is hovered over. The dropdown menu should give the option of “Breakfast”, “Lunch, “Dinner”, “Desserts” and “Drinks”.
- Create a jQuery function which contains a chained effect to slide all the elements of your page around repeatedly whilst changing the background.
- Create a jQuery function which fades a picture in and out over a period of 3 seconds each when the respective buttons are clicked.
- Create a jQuery function which can stop the animation of the above effect whilst in progress.
